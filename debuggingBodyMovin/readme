here you can find some issues i had (win10/chrome)...

- 2solid_one3d_oneNot does work if the 3d solid is the second/green one, but not if it's the first,
error: DOMException: Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on 'Node': 
The node before which the new node is to be inserted is not a child of this node.

- linkin with expression to 3d rotation gives this error:
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
    at s.execute [as getValue] (bodymovin.js:13)....
    (note that if other parameters, like position, are linked to a rotation of a 3d layer, 
    it gives me no error but neither works on setting position.) 
    
- Nested precomp works only if not 3d, otherwise (a comp with a 3d precomp with 3d layers) gives me:
Uncaught TypeError: this.addTo3dContainer is not a function...
